How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
It's a tool that allows a user to arrange the typical styling language to one that's more compatable across all browser types and allows users more flexibility.

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favotite is mixins, however they also give me the most trouble. I like the idea of what a mixin does and how simple it makes future styling, but I still get stuck on incorporating it in.
